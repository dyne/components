# Buttons help dyners initiate actions, from encrypt an email, to signa a document, to liking a post.

Buttons have label text that describes the **action that will occur** if a user taps a button.

An icon may optionally be added to a button to **help communicate the button's action** and help draw attention.

Buttons are often used for form submissions and to toggle elements into view.

## Emphasis

Buttons can have different level of emphasis based on the importance of the action that one dyner need to aim in the context.

1. **High** emphasis — For the primary, most important, or most common action on a screen
1. **Moderate** emphasis — For important actions that don’t distract from other onscreen elements
1. **Slight** emphasis — For optional or supplementary actions with the least amount of prominence

The component comes in different variants such as `primary`, `secondary`, `large` and `small` which you can use to alter the look and feel of the button.

## Inputs

Button has the following properties:

<Primary />

<Controls />

<Stories />
